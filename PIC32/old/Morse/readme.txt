Much like BI2SM16, but this time you need to use the Project -> Project Wizard.. to
create the MPLAB project yourself.

Select PIC24EP256GP202 when asked, use XC16 as the tool suite, save on your N: somewhere and finish without adding any files.
Copy the main.c file from here to that new project directory and then add that file using MPLAB (right click
source files and select Add file..)
